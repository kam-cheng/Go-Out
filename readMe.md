# Go Out!

Go Out! is a mobile app that gives its users the platform to find, attend, and organise a range of interesting activities that they enjoy, within the local area. All activities are organised by fellow users, giving them the opportunity to connect with like-minded people, hopefully increasing the sense of community within its local user base.

<br/>

## Download and run our App (support for android devices only)

---

[Download Link](https://expo.dev/artifacts/eas/j3WiqqvYhFLwrpCtBwEwZF.apk)

### Emulator Recommended:

If you have an emulator installed, simple drag the downloaded file to the emulator, swipe up to open the app drawer and open the "get-out" app".

For android devices, ensure that you have enabled apk installation from external sources. [Guide here](https://www.expressvpn.com/support/vpn-setup/enable-apk-installs-android/)

If you are unable to install the app using google chrome, we recommend using [ES File Explorer](https://es-file-explorer.en.uptodown.com/android)

Once enabled, click on the .apk file to install.
<br/>

## Tech Stack

---

- React Native
- Firebase
- Expo
- Android Emulator

<br/>

## Installation Instructions

In your terminal input the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kam-cheng/get-out.git
cd get-out
npm install
```

As Go Out! uses [react-native-google-autoplaces-complete](https://github.com/FaridSafi/react-native-google-places-autocomplete), you will need to add your own API key to the App.

To do so, get your [Google Places API keys](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/get-api-key/) and enable "Google Places API" in the console. Billing must be enabled on the account.

In the get-out directory create the folder `key`.

Inside the folder, create the file `Maps.js`.

In the file, input the following (replacing YOUR_API_KEY with the google places API key):

```
const MAPS_API_KEY = YOUR_API_KEY;

export default MAPS_API_KEY;

```

<br/>

## Minimum Versions Supported

---

- Node.js - 16.14.0

<br/>

## Enviroment Set-up

---

For development purposes you will need to set up [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

In order ot load the app on an android device, you will need to set up an emulator. We recommend using [Android Emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/) to run the app.

As we are using Expoâ€™s bare workflow, due to App's integration with React Native Firebase, you will not be able to load the app using Expo Go.

<br/>

## Running the App

---

In the terminal input the following:

```bash
npx react-native start
npx react-native run-android
```
